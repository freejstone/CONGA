A tool for discovering peptides with unaccounted for PTMs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Open Group-walk is a tool for discovering peptides in mass-spectrometry data with theoretical FDR control. It takes in the set of top 1 PSMs using a narrow search against a concatenated target-decoy database, the set of top k PSMs (or less if less than k PSMs exist) using an open search, again against a concatenated target-decoy database, and lastly the pairs of target and decoy peptide sequences from the database. Given this, Open Group-walk will return a discovery list of peptides. Group-walk is able to make simultaneous discoveries from both open- and narrow-search files. Group-walk is able to detect unaccounted for post-translational modifications of the sample peptides, and peptides generated by chimera experimental spectra.

Documentation
=============

A link to the documentation on read-the-docs will go here. For now, I will house it all locally using .rst files, which then can be easily transported over. Documentation will include a basic example, explanation of input parameters, and an explanation of columns in the output file. Not sure if we should also have a module-index since there is really only one module (users aren't able to use the individual functions used by main).

Paper
=====

A link to the biorXiv paper will eventually go here.

Installation
============

To install simply go to Code, Download Zip and extract the Zip file. Installation of the relevant package dependencies are required (see Groupwalk.py). Please see the documentation, specifically the tutorial, on how to run Open Group-walk.
