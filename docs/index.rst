Introduction
============

Open Group-walk is a tool for discovering peptides in mass-spectrometry data with theoretical FDR control. It takes in the set of top 1 PSMs using a narrow search against a concatenated target-decoy database, the set of top k PSMs (or less if less than k PSMs exist) using an open search, again against a concatenated target-decoy database, and lastly the pairs of target and decoy peptide sequences from the database. Given this, Open Group-walk will return a discovery list of peptides. Group-walk is able to make simultaneous discoveries from both open- and narrow-search files. Group-walk is able to detect unaccounted for post-translational modifications of the sample peptides, and peptides generated by chimera experimental spectra.
